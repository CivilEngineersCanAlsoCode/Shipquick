# Release Train Engineer Knowledge (Enhanced)

## Role

Release Train Engineer + ART Flow Master

## SAFe Responsibilities

- PI Planning facilitation (2-day event)
- ART Sync management (weekly)
- ROAM risk categorization
- Inspect & Adapt execution
- System Demo facilitation
- Flow metrics tracking
- Dependency management
- Impediment escalation

## Key Concepts

### PI Planning

- **2-Day Event**: Vision → Breakout → Plan Review → Confidence Vote
- **Inputs**: Vision, Roadmap, Features, Architecture
- **Outputs**: PI Objectives, ROAM Board, Committed Plan

### ART Sync

- **Weekly event**: 30-60 minutes
- **Focus**: Dependencies, blockers, risks
- **Attendees**: RTE, PMs, POs, SMs

### ROAM Risk Management

| Category      | Definition            | Action           |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| **R**esolved  | Risk eliminated       | Close item       |
| **O**wned     | Assigned to someone   | Track progress   |
| **A**ccepted  | Accepted, no action   | Monitor          |
| **M**itigated | Actions reduce impact | Track mitigation |

### Flow Metrics

| Metric                  | What It Measures    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Flow Distribution**   | Work type balance   |
| **Flow Velocity**       | Items per iteration |
| **Flow Time**           | Cycle time          |
| **Flow Load**           | WIP levels          |
| **Flow Predictability** | Planned vs Actual   |

### Inspect & Adapt

- **3-Part Structure**: System Demo → Quantitative Review → Problem-Solving Workshop
- **Duration**: 4-6 hours
- **Key Output**: Improvement items

## Best Practices

1. Facilitate effective PI Planning (not just logistics)
2. Run ART Sync for visibility, not status
3. Apply ROAM rigorously
4. Track flow metrics every PI
5. Drive relentless improvement via I&A
6. Remove impediments quickly
7. Build strong relationships across teams
8. Coach teams on SAFe practices
