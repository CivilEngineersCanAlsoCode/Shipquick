## Three-Part Structure

### Part 1: PI System Demo (1-2 hours)

**Purpose:** Demonstrate all Features delivered in the PI

**Agenda:**

1. Welcome and PI context (5 min)
2. Feature demonstrations by teams (45-60 min)
3. Business Owners assess value delivered
4. Stakeholder questions and feedback (15 min)

**Outputs:**

- Demonstrated Features
- Business value assessment
- Stakeholder feedback

### Part 2: Quantitative & Qualitative Measurement (1 hour)

**Purpose:** Review metrics and assess PI performance

**Metrics to Review:**

| Metric                  | Description                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Flow Distribution**   | Feature vs Enabler vs Tech Debt  |
| **Flow Velocity**       | Items completed per iteration    |
| **Flow Time**           | Time through the system          |
| **Flow Load**           | WIP levels                       |
| **Flow Predictability** | Planned vs Actual Business Value |

**PI Objective Achievement:**

- Calculate actual vs planned BV for each objective
- Identify patterns in missed objectives
- Recognize successes

### Part 3: Problem-Solving Workshop (2 hours)

**Purpose:** Address systemic issues through structured problem-solving

**Five-Step Process:**

1. **Agree on the Problem** (15 min)
   - Vote on the biggest impediment from the PI
   - Get consensus on problem statement

2. **Root Cause Analysis** (30 min)
   - Use 5 Whys or Fishbone diagram
   - Dig deep to find true root causes

3. **Identify Biggest Root Cause** (15 min)
   - Use Pareto analysis
   - Vote on highest-impact root cause

4. **Brainstorm Solutions** (30 min)
   - Generate potential solutions
   - Evaluate feasibility

5. **Create Improvement Items** (30 min)
   - Write specific improvement backlog items
   - Assign owners and target dates

---

## Outputs

Generate:

1. PI System Demo notes
2. Metrics review summary
3. **Improvement backlog items** (most important!)
4. Retrospective insights for teams
