## Process

### Step 1: Review Context

- What are our PI Objectives?
- What did we achieve last Iteration?
- What feedback do we have?

### Step 2: Review Committed Stories

- Which Stories are committed for this Iteration?
- What do they deliver together?

### Step 3: Define 2-4 Goals

Goals should be:

- Outcome-focused (not activities)
- Measurable
- Achievable in one Iteration
- Aligned with PI Objectives

### Step 4: Write Goal Statements

**Good examples:**

- "Complete user authentication flow"
- "Reduce API response time to <200ms"
- "Deploy payment integration to staging"

**Bad examples:**

- "Work on login" (activity, not outcome)
- "Continue development" (not specific)

### Step 5: Team Agreement

- Review goals with team
- Get commitment
