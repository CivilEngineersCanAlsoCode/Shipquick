# Step 2: Define NFR Categories & Thresholds

## STEP GOAL

Establish the NFR categories to assess and the thresholds used for validation.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`
- 🚫 Never guess thresholds

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Select Categories

Use the ADR Quality Readiness Checklist (8 categories):

1. Testability & Automation
2. Test Data Strategy
3. Scalability & Availability
4. Disaster Recovery
5. Security
6. Monitorability/Debuggability/Manageability
7. QoS/QoE
8. Deployability

Add any `custom_nfr_categories` if provided.

---

## 2. Define Thresholds

For each category, extract thresholds from:

- tech-spec (primary)
- PRD (secondary)
- story or test-design (feature-specific)

If a threshold is unknown, mark it **UNKNOWN** and plan to report **CONCERNS**.

---

## 3. Confirm NFR Matrix

List each NFR category with its threshold or UNKNOWN status.

Load next step: `{nextStepFile}`

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.

## MEMORY CAPTURE

- **Mistake Tracking**: Append any user-corrected assumptions or agent errors to test-architect-sidecar/common-mistakes.md.
- **Learning**: Document new patterns or decisions to test-architect-sidecar/decomposition-patterns.md.
