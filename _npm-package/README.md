# Shipquick Installer

**The Enterprise Agile Agentic Framework**

Shipquick is the fastest way to spin up a **SAFe 6.0.1 compliant**, **AI-native** software project. It comes pre-packaged with the **BMAD Method**, **Test Architect (TEA)**, and **Beads** for state management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

You don't need to clone this repo. Just run:

```bash
npx shipquick install
```

This interactive installer will:

1.  **Set up the Framework**: Installs core agents, workflows, and configuration.
2.  **configure Your IDE**: Optimizes Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code settings.
3.  **Initialize Beads**: Sets up a local, git-backed issue tracker (`bd`).
4.  **Audit Compliance**: Ensures your folder structure meets SAFe standards.

## 📦 What's Included?

- **Agents**: Pre-prompted personas for PM, Architect, RTE, Dev, and QA.
- **Workflows**: 100+ executable `.md` workflows for every stage of development.
- **Beads (`bd`)**: A distributed, graph-based memory system for your agents. (Vendored and ready to use).
- **TestArch**: A production-ready testing scaffold.

## 🛠 Usage

After installation:

1.  Open the folder in your IDE.
2.  Run `/000 Activate Shipquick` in Chat to initialize the brain.
3.  Start building with `/010 SQ: Init`.
