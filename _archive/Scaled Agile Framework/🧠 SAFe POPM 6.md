## **1.2 The Lean-Agile Mindset**

### **Concept: The Agile Manifesto**

The foundation of Agile development, valuing:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.  
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.  
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.  
* **Responding to change** over following a plan.

### **Concept: SAFe Lean-Agile Principles**

2. **Apply systems thinking.**  
3. **Assume variability; preserve options.**  
4. **Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles.**  
5. **Base Milestones on objective evaluation of working systems.**  
6. **Make value flow without interruptions.**  
7. **Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning.**  
8. **Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers.**  
9. **Decentralize decision-making.**  
10. **Organize around value.**

## **1.3 Value Streams**

### **Concept: Operational Value Streams**

**SAFe Level:** Portfolio

#### **Definition**

The sequence of activities needed to deliver a product or service to a Customer.

#### **Examples**

* Manufacturing a product.  
* Fulfilling an e-commerce order.  
* Admitting and treating a patient.  
* Providing a loan.

### **Concept: Development Value Streams**

**SAFe Level:** Portfolio

#### **Definition**

The sequence of activities needed to convert a business hypothesis into a technology-enabled product or service that delivers Customer value. These value streams build the systems that *enable* Operational Value Streams.

#### **Structure**

* **Trigger:** Feature Request.  
* **Process:** Define \-\> Build \-\> Validate \-\> Release.  
* **Value:** New increment of value.

### **Concept: Agile Release Train (ART)**

**SAFe Level:** Program

#### **Definition**

A virtual organization of 5 to 12 teams (50 to 125 individuals) that plans, commits, and executes together.

#### **Key Characteristics**

* **Cross-functional:** Contains all capabilities (software, hardware, firmware, testing, compliance, etc.) needed to deliver value.  
* **Aligned:** Aligns to a common mission via the ART Backlog.  
* **Cadence:** Synchronizes on a common cadence (The Planning Interval).

# **Lesson 2: Preparing for PI Planning**

## **2.1 PI Planning**

### **Concept: Planning Interval (PI)**

**SAFe Level:** Program

#### **Definition**

A timebox (typically 8–12 weeks) during which an ART delivers incremental value in the form of working, tested software and systems. It consists of multiple development Iterations followed by one Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration.

### **Concept: PI Planning Event**

#### **Definition**

A cadence-based event that serves as the heartbeat of the ART, aligning all teams on the ART to a shared mission and Vision.

* **Features:** What benefit hypotheses are provided?  
* **Audience:** For whom does it provide benefit?  
* **NFRs:** What performance, reliability, or platform requirements exist?

#### **Common Formats**

* Rolling wave briefings.

#### **Definition**

A long-term view (multi-year) showing key milestones and deliverables.

#### **Components**

* **Timeline:** Q1, Q2, Q3, etc.  
* **Deliverables:** Epics, Capabilities, major Milestones.

### **Concept: PI Roadmap**

**SAFe Level:** Program

#### **Definition**

A shorter-term view (1-3 PIs) with higher fidelity.

#### **Structure**

* **Current PI (Committed):** What we are building now.  
* **Next 2 PIs (Forecast):** Projected Features and Milestones.

### **Concept: Market Rhythms & Events**

#### **Market Rhythms**

Cyclical and predictable events (e.g., Holiday shopping, annual enrollment, fiscal year end). These define the **Optimal Release Window**.

#### **Market Events**

Ad-hoc and unpredictable (e.g., Competitor release, regulatory change, technology breakthrough). These require agility to respond.

---

## **2.4 Customer-centric Features**

### **Concept: Feature**

**SAFe Level:** Program

#### **Definition**

A service that fulfills a stakeholder need. Each Feature includes a name, a benefit hypothesis, and acceptance criteria. It must be sized to be delivered by a single ART in a single PI.

#### **Hierarchy**

1. **Epic:** Portfolio level container for significant initiatives.  
2. **Feature:** Program level service fulfilling a need.  
3. **Story:** Team level description of desired functionality.

#### **Tools for Creating Features**

1. **Personas:** Characterizations of the people who might use the product (e.g., "Mike the Fleet Manager").  
2. **Customer Journey Maps:** Visualization of the end-to-end Customer experience (Decide \-\> Learn \-\> Choose \-\> Apply \-\> Purchase \-\> Complete).  
3. **Whole-Product Thinking:**  
   * *Generic Product:* Minimum to satisfy.  
   * *Expected Product:* Typical features.  
   * *Augmented Product:* Differentiators.  
   * *Potential Product:* Future vision.

## **2.5 ART Backlog and Kanban**

### **Concept: ART Backlog**

**SAFe Level:** Program

#### **Definition**

The holding area for upcoming Features and Enablers that will address user needs and deliver business benefits for a single ART.

#### **Roles**

* **Content Authority:** Product Management prioritizes the ART Backlog.  
* **Collaboration:** System Architects help prioritize Enablers.

### **Concept: Capacity Allocation**

#### **Definition**

A policy to balance different types of work within the backlog.

#### **Typical Categories**

* New Features (Business value).  
* Enablers (Architectural Runway).  
* Tech Debt / Maintenance.

#### **Why This Matters**

Prevents the "tyranny of the urgent" where immediate features crowd out necessary architectural work or maintenance, ensuring long-term system health.

### **Concept: WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)**

#### **Definition**

A prioritization model used to sequence jobs (e.g., Features, Capabilities, Epics) to produce maximum economic benefit.

#### **Formula**

$$WSJF \= \\frac{\\text{Cost of Delay (CoD)}}{\\text{Job Size (Duration)}}$$

#### **Components of Cost of Delay (CoD)**

1. **User-Business Value:** Relative value to the customer or business. Revenue impact? Penalty?  
2. **Time Criticality:** Is there a fixed deadline? Will they wait? Decay of value over time?  
3. **Risk Reduction / Opportunity Enablement (RR/OE):** Does this reduce future risk or enable new business opportunities?

#### **Calculation Logic**

1. Score each component of CoD using relative Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20...).  
2. Sum the three components to get Total CoD.  
3. Estimate Job Size (Duration) using relative numbers.  
4. Divide Total CoD by Job Size.  
5. Highest WSJF score is prioritized first.

* **M**easurable  
* **A**chievable  
* **R**ealistic  
* **T**ime-bound

### **Concept: Uncommitted Objectives**

#### **Definition**

Planned objectives that are *not* included in the commitment but are part of the plan.

#### **When This Is Used**

* When a team has low confidence in meeting the objective.  
* When the objective has many unknowns (high risk).  
* Note: They *do* count toward capacity/load but *not* toward the reliability metric.

---

## **3.3 Manage Dependencies**

### **Concept: ART Planning Board**

* **Unbalanced Teams:** One team has too much load; another has capacity.  
* **Complex Critical Path:** Multiple teams linked in a chain.

---

## **3.4 Manage Risks**

### **Concept: ROAMing Risks**

#### **Definition**

A categorization method used during the Final Plan Review to address ART PI Risks.

#### **Categories (ROAM)**

* **R \- Resolved:** The risk has been addressed; no longer a concern.  
* **O \- Owned:** Someone has taken responsibility to handle it.  
* **A \- Accepted:** Nothing more can be done; if it occurs, the release may be compromised.  
* **M \- Mitigated:** Team has a plan to adjust if the risk occurs.

### **Concept: Confidence Vote**

A "Fist of Five" vote taken by the teams and the ART to indicate confidence in the plan.

* **Commitment:** Teams agree to do everything in their power to meet objectives and escalate immediately if feasibility changes.
