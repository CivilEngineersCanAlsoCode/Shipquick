# Step 5: Validate & Complete

## STEP GOAL

Validate ATDD outputs and provide a completion summary.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`
- ✅ Validate against the checklist

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Validation

Use `checklist.md` to validate:

- Prerequisites satisfied
- Test files created correctly
- Checklist matches acceptance criteria
- Tests are designed to fail before implementation
- [ ] CLI sessions cleaned up (no orphaned browsers)
- [ ] Temp artifacts stored in `{test_artifacts}/` not random locations

Fix any gaps before completion.

---

## 2. Completion Summary

Report:

- Test files created
- Checklist output path
- Key risks or assumptions
- Next recommended workflow (e.g., implementation or `automate`)

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.

## MEMORY CAPTURE

- **Mistake Tracking**: Append any user-corrected assumptions or agent errors to test-architect-sidecar/common-mistakes.md.
- **Learning**: Document new patterns or decisions to test-architect-sidecar/decomposition-patterns.md.
