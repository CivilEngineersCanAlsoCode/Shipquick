# Step 2: Generation Mode Selection

## STEP GOAL

Choose the appropriate generation mode for ATDD tests.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

- 📖 Read the entire step file before acting
- ✅ Speak in `{communication_language}`

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Follow the MANDATORY SEQUENCE exactly
- 💾 Record outputs before proceeding
- 📖 Load the next step only when instructed

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: config, loaded artifacts, and knowledge fragments
- Focus: this step's goal only
- Limits: do not execute future steps
- Dependencies: prior steps' outputs (if any)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise.

## 1. Default Mode: AI Generation

Use AI generation when:

- Acceptance criteria are clear
- Scenarios are standard (CRUD, auth, API, navigation)

Proceed directly to test strategy if this applies.

---

## 2. Optional Mode: Recording (Complex UI)

Use recording when UI interactions need live browser verification.

**Tool selection based on `config.tea_browser_automation`:**

If `auto`:

> **Note:** `${timestamp}` is a placeholder the agent should replace with a unique value (e.g., epoch seconds) for session isolation.

- **Simple recording** (snapshot selectors, capture structure): Use CLI
  - `playwright-cli -s=tea-atdd-${timestamp} open <url>` → `playwright-cli -s=tea-atdd-${timestamp} snapshot` → extract refs
- **Complex recording** (drag/drop, wizards, multi-step state): Use MCP
  - Full browser automation with rich tool semantics
- **Fallback:** If preferred tool unavailable, use the other; if neither, skip recording

If `cli`:

- Use Playwright CLI for all recording
- `playwright-cli -s=tea-atdd-${timestamp} open <url>`, `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `click <ref>`, etc.

If `mcp`:

- Use Playwright MCP tools for all recording (current behavior)
- Confirm MCP availability, record selectors and interactions

If `none`:

- Skip recording mode entirely, use AI generation from documentation

---

## 3. Confirm Mode

State the chosen mode and why. Then proceed.

Load next step: `{nextStepFile}`

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS:

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Step completed in full with required outputs

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Skipped sequence steps or missing outputs
  **Master Rule:** Skipping steps is FORBIDDEN.

## MEMORY CAPTURE

- **Mistake Tracking**: Append any user-corrected assumptions or agent errors to test-architect-sidecar/common-mistakes.md.
- **Learning**: Document new patterns or decisions to test-architect-sidecar/decomposition-patterns.md.
